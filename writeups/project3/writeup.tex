\textbf{Notes:} \\

We require clients to operate on files within a transaction in filename order to avoid deadlock.
So, if a client wants to do: 
	Get g => x
	Put x => f
They have to actually do:
	Append "" => f
	Get g => x
	Put x => f

\textbf{TFS Log Entry Format:} \\

<client_address>
<Operation type>
<filename>
<contents_line_count>
<contents>

contents_line_count is -1 for operations that don't have contents
there is a line separator after each <entry> including the contents
